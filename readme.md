# React Native - Puzzle game
A personal project to showcase my code.\
The small puzzle game with liquid swipe menu.\

I used Gesture-Handler for interactions and Reanimated 2 for animations, also some Lottie's for more interesting look. The liquid effect was done with dynamic svg curves (iOS-version also has a mask effect as it is hardware accelerated).  

Here's the Figma project with Flow prototype and YouTube video of the App:\
