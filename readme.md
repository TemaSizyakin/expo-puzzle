# React Native - Puzzle game
A small puzzle game with liquid swipe menu. A personal project.

I used Gesture-Handler for interactions and Reanimated 2 for animations, also some Lottie's for more interesting look. The liquid effect was done with dynamic svg curves (iOS-version also has a mask effect as it is hardware accelerated).

For UI/UX design I used Figma. Here's the project with Flow prototype:\
